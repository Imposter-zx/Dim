# Dim (▽) Programming Language

Dim is a statically-compiled, high-performance programming language designed for the modern era of computing. It bridges the gap between **high-level ergonomics** (Python-like syntax) and **low-level control** (C++ performance), with first-class support for **AI/ML**, **Security**, and **Structured Concurrency**.

## ▽ Key Features

- **Indentation-Based Syntax**: Clean, readable code without the noise of braces or semicolons.
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Memory safety without a garbage collector by default, ensuring zero-cost abstractions.
- **First-Class AI/ML**: Native `prompt` objects, structured output verification, and MLIR-based tensor acceleration with automatic differentiation.
- **Capability-Based Security**: Strict control over system resources and native taint tracking to prevent vulnerabilities at the compiler level.
- **Formal Verification**: Integrated SMT solver support (`verify` blocks) to prove code correctness at compile-time.
- **Modern Concurrency**: Structured concurrency with Actors and Async/Await, optimized for high-performance I/O.

## ▽ Syntax Preview

```dim
fn calculate_risk(input: Tensor[f32], model: Model) -> f32:
    # Deterministic inference block with sandboxed context
    with model.context:
        let prediction = model.forward(input)
        return prediction.mean()

prompt AnalyzeVulnerability(code: string):
    role system: "You are a security auditor."
    role user: "Review this snippet: {code}"
    output: VulnerabilityReport
```

## ▽ Current Project Status

This repository contains the **Dim Compiler Frontend Prototype**, including:

- `dim_poc_lexer.py`: Lexical analysis for Dim.
- `dim_parser.py`: PEG-based parser generating the AST.
- `dim_ast.py`: Abstract Syntax Tree definitions.
- `dim_semantic.py`: Semantic analyzer for scope and symbol validation.
- `dim_cli.py`: Unified CLI for running tests and exploring the compilation pipeline.

## ▽ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+

### Usage

The Dim CLI provides several tools for interacting with the compiler:

```bash
# Run internal compiler tests
python dim_cli.py --test

# Parse a Dim source file and show the AST
python dim_cli.py path/to/source.dim --ast

# Run semantic analysis on a file
python dim_cli.py path/to/source.dim --analyze

# Show tokens generated by the lexer
python dim_cli.py path/to/source.dim --tokens
```
